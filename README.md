# Turning Raw Clicks into Actionable Insights ðŸš€

This project showcases an **end-to-end analytics engineering workflow** for Google Analytics event data, transforming raw clickstream data into actionable business insights.

---

## Project Overview
I managed a full-stack analytics pipeline, covering **data ingestion, transformation, and visualization**, with the goal of understanding user behavior, optimizing campaigns, and uncovering actionable insights.

---

## Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion
- Pulled raw event data from Google Analytics using **Airbyte**.  
- Loaded data into **Snowflake** with **incremental syncs** for efficiency and scalability.

### 2. Data Transformation
- Processed and structured data in **dbt**, building **staging** and **mart layers** for key metrics such as engagement rate, funnel drop-offs, and session value.  
- Implemented **dbt tests** to ensure data quality, checking for duplicates, null values, and consistency across sessions and users.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Developed interactive **Tableau dashboards** to track user behavior, monitor campaign performance, and analyze conversion paths.  
- Enabled stakeholders to explore insights dynamically, supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights
- High-click campaigns didnâ€™t always convert â€” indicating landing page optimization opportunities.  
- Engagement dropped sharply after specific interactions, highlighting friction points in the user journey.  
- A small segment of users contributed disproportionately to high-value sessions, presenting opportunities for **personalized targeting**.

---

## Next Steps / Future Enhancements
- Implement **event-level anomaly detection** to proactively flag unusual traffic patterns or drop-offs.  
- Track **multi-touch attribution** to better understand campaign contributions across the user journey.  
- Expand product-level insights to include **revenue per product variant or category over time**, supporting deeper business strategy.
